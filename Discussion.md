Solutions Considered
Linear Search:

Description: Read the entire file line by line and filter logs based on the target date.

Pros: Simple to implement.

Cons: Inefficient for a 1 TB file, as it requires reading the entire file for every query.

External Tools (e.g., grep):

Description: Use command-line tools like grep to filter logs by date.

Pros: Quick to implement and leverages existing tools.

Cons: Not as flexible for custom requirements, and performance may degrade for very large files.

Indexing:

Description: Create an index file that maps dates to byte offsets in the log file.

Pros: Extremely fast for repeated queries, as it allows direct seeking to the relevant part of the file.

Cons: Requires preprocessing to create the index, which can be time-consuming for the first run.

Binary Search:

Description: Use binary search to locate the starting position of logs for the target date in a chronologically sorted file.

Pros: Efficient for large files, as it avoids reading the entire file. No preprocessing required.

Cons: Assumes the file is sorted chronologically, which may not always be the case.

Parallel Processing:

Description: Split the file into chunks and process them in parallel.

Pros: Can speed up processing for very large files.

Cons: Adds complexity and may not be necessary if the file is already sorted.

Final Solution Summary
The binary search approach was chosen as the final solution because:

It is efficient for large files, as it avoids reading the entire file.

It does not require preprocessing, unlike the indexing approach.

It works well for chronologically sorted log files, which is a reasonable assumption for log files.

It is simple to implement and provides a good balance between performance and complexity.

The binary search approach locates the starting position of logs for the target date in logarithmic time, and then reads logs sequentially until the date changes. This ensures that the solution is both fast and memory-efficient.
